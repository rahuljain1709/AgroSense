Kidney beans (rajma) grow well in cool to moderate climates. 
They prefer well-drained loamy soils and do not tolerate waterlogging. 
As a legume, kidney beans fix nitrogen and require primarily phosphorus and micronutrients. 
Adequate spacing and early weed control improve plant growth. 
The crop is sensitive to frost during early growth stages. 
Harvesting should be done when pods mature and dry.
