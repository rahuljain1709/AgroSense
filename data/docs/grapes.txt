Grapes thrive in dry, warm climates and require well-drained sandy loam soils. 
They benefit from pruning and training systems that improve sunlight exposure and fruit quality. 
Grapes have high nutrient demand, especially for potash, which influences berry size and sweetness. 
Irrigation scheduling is important during berry development. 
Proper disease management, especially powdery mildew and downy mildew, is essential.
