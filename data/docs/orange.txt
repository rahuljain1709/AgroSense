Orange is a citrus fruit crop suited for warm climates with moderate rainfall. 
It grows best in well-drained loamy soils. 
Oranges require regular irrigation during dry periods and benefit from mulching. 
Balanced fertilization, including micronutrients like zinc and magnesium, improves fruit quality. 
The crop is sensitive to waterlogging and salinity. 
Proper pest and disease management, especially for citrus canker and psyllids, is essential.
