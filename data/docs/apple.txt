Apple is a temperate fruit crop requiring cool winters and mild summers. 
It thrives in well-drained loamy soils rich in organic matter. 
Apple orchards require proper chilling hours during winter to break dormancy and ensure uniform flowering. 
Regular pruning is essential for canopy management, improving air circulation, and enhancing fruit quality. 
Apple trees benefit from balanced NPK nutrition, along with micronutrients like boron and zinc. 
Adequate pollination from bees is important for fruit set. 
Apple orchards are sensitive to waterlogging; therefore proper drainage and irrigation management are critical.
