It prefers well-drained loamy soils and is highly sensitive to waterlogging. 
Being a legume, blackgram fixes atmospheric nitrogen and requires less nitrogen fertilizer but responds well to phosphorus application. 
Early weed control is important to ensure good plant stand. 
The crop matures quickly and fits well into multiple cropping systems. 
Blackgram improves soil fertility and is valuable for crop rotations.
