Mango is a tropical fruit tree thriving in warm climates with moderate rainfall. 
It performs well in deep loamy soils with good drainage. 
Young mango orchards require regular irrigation, whereas mature trees can tolerate dry spells. 
Pruning improves canopy shape and sunlight penetration. 
Flowering is sensitive to temperature fluctuations; stable weather improves fruit set. 
Mango trees benefit from organic manure and balanced fertilization.
