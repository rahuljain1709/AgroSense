Soil health is the foundation of crop productivity. Good soil has a balance of minerals, organic matter, water, and air. 
Loamy soil, which is a mix of sand, silt, and clay, is generally ideal for most crops because it drains well but still holds moisture and nutrients. 
Sandy soils drain very quickly and are easy to work but they lose water and nutrients fast, so they benefit from organic matter like compost. 
Clay soils hold water and nutrients but can become waterlogged and hard; they need proper drainage and structure improvement. 
Organic matter improves all soil types. It increases water-holding capacity, improves structure, and supports beneficial soil microbes.
Regular soil testing helps a farmer understand pH, nutrient levels, and organic content so that they can choose crops and fertilizers wisely.
