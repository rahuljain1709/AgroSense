Coffee is a plantation crop grown in tropical highlands with moderate temperatures and regular rainfall. 
It prefers well-drained loamy soils rich in organic matter. 
Shade trees are essential to protect coffee plants from direct sunlight and maintain the microclimate. 
Regular pruning, mulching, and organic manure improve soil health and yield. 
Coffee requires timely pest and disease management, especially for leaf rust and stem borer.
