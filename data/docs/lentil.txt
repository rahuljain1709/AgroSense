Lentil is a winter pulse crop suited to dry and cool climates. 
It prefers well-drained sandy loam soils and does not tolerate waterlogging. 
Lentils fix nitrogen and require limited nitrogen fertilizer but respond to phosphorus. 
The crop is drought-tolerant and fits well into cereal-based rotations. 
Timely sowing and proper seed treatment improve yield.
