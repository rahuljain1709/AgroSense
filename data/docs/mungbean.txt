Mungbean (green gram) is a short-duration pulse crop tolerant to heat and dry conditions. 
It grows well in sandy loam to loamy soils that drain efficiently. 
Mungbean fixes nitrogen and requires limited nitrogen fertilizer but responds well to phosphorus. 
It is often grown in rotations after cereals due to its soil-improving properties. 
Weed control in early stages and timely irrigation improve yields.
