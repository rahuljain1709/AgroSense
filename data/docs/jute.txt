Jute is a fiber crop grown in warm and humid climates with abundant rainfall. 
It prefers fertile alluvial soils with good moisture retention. 
Timely sowing and adequate weeding help maintain plant vigor. 
The crop requires good nutrition and responds well to organic matter. 
Harvesting at the right stage ensures better fiber quality, and retting must be done properly to extract long, soft fibers.
