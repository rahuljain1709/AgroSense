Watermelon is a warm-season fruit crop that thrives in sandy loam soils with good drainage. 
It prefers dry climates and is sensitive to excess moisture. 
Watermelon requires adequate irrigation during vine growth and fruit enlargement but should not be over-watered near harvest. 
Balanced fertilization, especially potassium, improves sweetness and fruit size. 
Pollination by bees is vital for uniform fruit development.
