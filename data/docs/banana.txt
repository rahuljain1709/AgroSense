Banana is a tropical fruit crop requiring warm temperatures and high humidity. 
It performs best in deep, well-drained loamy soils with high organic content. 
Banana plants are heavy feeders and require regular application of organic manure and balanced fertilizers. 
Consistent moisture is essential; drip irrigation improves water-use efficiency. 
The crop is sensitive to strong winds and lodging, so propping and windbreaks are useful. 
Good sucker selection and timely removal of excess suckers ensure healthy plant growth. 
Harvesting is done when the fruits are filled and angles disappear.
