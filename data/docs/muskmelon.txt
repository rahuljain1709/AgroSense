Muskmelon is a warm-season fruit crop that thrives in sandy or sandy loam soils. 
It prefers dry climates and is sensitive to excess moisture or waterlogging. 
Good soil drainage and raised beds improve plant health. 
Balanced application of fertilizers and timely irrigation during fruit development are important. 
Muskmelon requires pollination for good fruit set, and bee activity improves yield.
